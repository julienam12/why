Experiment 1 v2 Layout

Diseases
A, B, C, D

Proteins 
X, Y

Fever
(fever)

IVs:
	-levels of information given
		- 1,2 (disease & protein)
		- 1,3 (disease & fever)
		- 2,3 (protein & fever)
	-causal relationship between info pieces
		-direct
			e.g. Disease A & Fever. (disease A causes proteins X and Y which cause fever)
		-indirect
			e.g. Protein X & Fever. (protein X is needed but also needs protein Y to get fever)
	-5 total conditions (no way of getting direct causal relationship b/w protein & fever)
	-reduce to 5 trials 
		-randomly choose from the possible question space for each condition
		-e.g., for disease & protein direct there are 5 options. Choose 1 randomly for ppt to see
			-Disease A, Protein X
			-Disease A, Protein Y
			-Disease B, Protein X
			-Disease C, Protein Y
			-Disease D, Protein Y
