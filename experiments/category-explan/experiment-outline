EXPERIMENT OUTLINE

Condition 1: Likelihood
"How likely is it that [X] has [TRAIT] given that it [IS/IS NOT] in [CATEGORY]?"
//X can be a NAME, SUBCATEGORY, or just 'X'
//For every sentence, get equal [IS] and [IS NOT] trials
Examples:
	How likely is that [JAKE] [DOES HIS HOMEOWRK] given that he [IS] a [GOOD STUDENT]
	How likely is it that [AN ANIMAL] [LAYS EGGS] given that it [IS NOT] a [MAMMAL]
	How likely is it that ['X'] [HAS TIRES] given that it [IS NOT] a [TRUCK]
	How likely is it that [CAROL] [DOESN'T EAT PORK] given that she [IS] [ORTHODOX JEWISH]
	How likely is it that [A TRIANGLE] [HAS THREE SIDES] given that it [IS] [ACCUTE]

Condition 2: Explanation Acceptability
"To what degree is this a good explanation?"
[SUPERCATEGORY] has [TRAIT] because it is in [CATEGORY]
Examples:
	[JAKE] [DOES HIS HOMEWORK] because he is a [GOOD STUDENT]
	[THE ANIMAL] [DOESN'T LAYS EGGS] because it is a [MAMMAL]
	['X'] [HAS TIRES] because it is a [TRUCK]
	[CAROL] [DOESN'T EAT PORK] because she is [ORTHODOX JEWISH]
	[THE TRIANGLE] [HAS THREE SIDES] because it is [ACCUTE]

Look for correlation between P(trait | category) - P(trait | ¬category) and acceptability
More precisely: P(explan) ~ P(trait | supercategory & category) - P(trait | supercategory & ¬category)

Girrafes are warm blooded because they are mammals
Girrafes are warm blooded because they are vertebrates
Girrages are warm bloooded because they are horse-like creatures

Issues:
	Should we provide a baseline or not? There will be much different results depending on this. Using 'X' reduces chances of confounds, gives us more exact control. However, it might be too weird for subjects to try to apply ajectives without a reasonable object to apply them too; in some cases such as "accute," the triangle subcategory will be assumed.

	For condition 2, should there be any sort of backstory, or can we just take the explanations out of context?

	Would it be better to provide a number of multiple choice options for an explanation, e.g.
	"Jake does his homework because:"
	1. he is a good student
	2. he is blonde
	3. he is a middle schooler
	4. he thinks it's important //should we have non-category explanations?
	If this is better, how would we design the multiple choices? Perhaps, systematically vary P(explan)?

	because he is a _______
